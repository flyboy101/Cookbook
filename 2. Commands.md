# Part 0 - Prepare USB live
1. Download the latest version of your favourite Linux system
   
2. Create a live USB with Rufus (with or without persistance as you fancy)
   
   https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview

3. Boot Linux operating system to RAM via live USB
   
4. Set up a computer name, user, and password 

5. Update your freshly booted Linux system
   ```js
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   ```

# Part 1 - Install Bitcoin Core

## Download binaries from Bitcoin Core repository
1. Set up client version as ambient variable for easy installation. Check last version on https://bitcoin.org/bin/
   ```js
   VERSION=28.1
   ```
     
2. Download Linux binaries from Bitcoin Core repository, checksums and signatures
   ```js
   wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```
   ```js
   wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/SHA256SUMS.asc
   wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/SHA256SUMS
   wget https://bitcoin.org/laanwj-releases.asc
   ```

## Check binaries
   1. Checksum check: check that the reference checksum in file `SHA256SUMS` matches the calculated checksum
      ```js
      sha256sum --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
      ```
      Output: "bitcoin-0.16.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz: OK"

   2. Manually check the fingerprint of the public key
      ```js
      sudo gpg ./laanwj-releases.asc
      ```
      Output: 01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964
   3. Signature check: Import the public key and verify the checksums file is cryptographically signes by the signed key
      ```js
      sudo gpg --import ./laanwj-releases.asc
      sudo gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
      ```
      Output: "Good signature from Wladimir ..."

## Installation
4. Extract the Bitcoin Core binaries, install them and check everything is fine by running `bitcoind`. Finally remove the tar file to save disk space
   ```js
   sudo tar -xzvf bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```
   ```js
   sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-$VERSION/bin/bitcoin-cli bitcoin-$VERSION/bin/bitcoind
   ```
   ```js
   bitcoind --version
   ```
   Output: Bitcoin Core Daemon version ...
   ```js
   rm /home/ubuntu/bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```

## Setup directories
5. Add a symbolic link (soft link) that points the freshly created `.bitcoind` directory on the root to the external hard disk 
   1. This folder is where all the blockchain data is stored. If you deleted it, then the next time you launched Bitcoin it would just begin to sync from the beginning, creating all of the data files stored in this directory once again. 
      ```js
      sudo ln -s /media/ubuntu/B680AD7C80AD43A9/.bitcoin /home/ubuntu/.bitcoin
      ```
   2. Navigate to the home directory and check the symbolic link is not shown in red (this would indicate an error). The content of this directory will actually be on the external hard disk
      ```js
      ls -la .bitcoin
      ```
      
## Setup configuration file
6. By default `bitcoind` searches for the configuration file `bitcoin.conf` in the default hidden direcotry `~/.bitcoin`. Download the configuration file (which manages all bitcoind settings) from repo and copy it into the default bitcoin-core's data directory. 
   ```js
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyboy101/Cookbook/refs/heads/master/bitcoin.conf
   sudo cp /home/ubuntu/bitcoin.conf /home/ubuntu/.bitcoin
   ```
 
## Running Bitcoin Core
7. Launch the deamon and start up the Initial Block Download (IBD)
    ```js
    bitcoind
    ```
    or override via argument the default configuration by specifying the position of the configuration file:
    ```js
    bitcoind -conf=/home/ubuntu/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
    ```

## NOTE:

* You can always stop at anytime the Initial Blockchain Download (IBD) by pressing on terminal `Ctl+c`
   
* Note that you can’t run both the GUI version `bitcoin-qt` and the daemon `bitcoind` at the same time using the same configuration directory.

* You may be interested in performing the Initial Blockchain Download (IBD) over the clearnet for speed, and then switching to Tor afterwards.


# Part 2 - Aftermath of IBD
1. Reduce the cache size by commenting `dbcache` and `blocksonly`
   ```js
   nano .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
   ```
2. Make changes effective by relaunching bitcoin daemon
   ```js
   sudo systemctl restart bitcoind
   ```
3. Check everything works
   ```js
   journalctl -fu bitcoind
   ```


# Part 3 - Privacy: Instal, configure and launch Tor Daemon 
---

Running your own Bitcoin node at home makes you a direct, sovereign peer on the Bitcoin network. However, if not configured without privacy in mind, it also tells the world that there is someone with Bitcoin at that address.

True, it's only your IP address that is revealed, but using services like [iplocation.net](https://www.iplocation.net){:target="_blank"}, your physical address can be determined quite accurately.
Especially with Lightning, your IP address would be widely used.
We need to make sure that you keep your privacy.

We'll also make it easy to connect to your node from outside your home network as an added benefit.

---

This section will cover installing Tor, and configuring the Tor software to make it ready when running Bitcoin. First we’re going to install Tor, and then configure it to launch when the computer starts. This will not change any network behavior when you’re browsing/using the Internet, and everything you normally do will still go over the normal Internet. Starting Tor just means that the Tor software is ready to be used by other software. Starting Tor when the computer starts just means we don’t have to remember to launch it every time we start our Bitcoin nodes.

## Install Tor

1. Install the dependency
   ```sh
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https
   ```
2. Create a new file via nano called `tor.list` 
   ```js
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
   ```
   and add the following entries for the precomplied packages `deb` and the source code `deb-src` hosted in the repository
   ```js   
   deb     [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org jammy main
   deb-src [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org jammy main
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
   ```
   Save and exit by pressing `CTRL+X`, then confirm with `Y`
2. Then up to `"root"` user temporarily to add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following commands, and finally logout from `"root"` and return to `admin` using `exit`
   ```js
   sudo su
   ```
   ```js   
   wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
   ```
   ```js
   exit
   ```
3. Install Tor and Tor debian keyring
   ```js
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get install -y tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```
4. Check Tor has been correctly installed
   ```js
   tor --version
   ```
## Configuring Tor for Bitcoin

Bitcoin Core communicate directly with the Tor daemon to route all traffic through the Tor network. We need to enable Tor to accept commands via its control port, with the proper authentication.

1. Modify Tor configuration on torrc
   ```js
   sudo nano +56 /etc/tor/torrc --linenumbers
   ```   
2. Open port 9051 eliminating symbol `#` from raw Nr. 56
3. Relaunch Tor service to make changes effective 
    ```js
    sudo systemctl reload tor
    ```
4. Check Tor is up and listening default ports 9050 and 9051 in localhost (127.0.0.1)
    ```js
    sudo ss -tulpn | grep tor
    ```
    Expected output:
   ```js
   
   ```

# Part 4 - RPC API interaction
Check out the `bitcoin-cli` reference here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list
1. `bitcoin-cli` is the command-line helper which comes with Bitcoin Core and can be used to interact with the bitcoin node. To check the bitcoin core status run
   ```js
   bitcoin-cli -getinfo
   ```
   
2. All available RPC API commands can be consulted here:
   https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html
