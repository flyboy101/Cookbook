# Part 0 - Prepare USB live
1. Download the latest version of your favourite Linux system
   
2. Create a live USB with Rufus (with or without persistance as you fancy)
   
   https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview

3. Boot Linux operating system to RAM via live USB
   
4. Set up a computer name, user, and password 

5. Update your freshly booted Linux system
   ```js
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   ```

# Part 1 - Install Bitcoin Core

## Download binaries from Bitcoin Core repository
1. Set up client version as ambient variable for easy installation. Check last version on https://bitcoin.org/bin/
   ```js
   VERSION=28.1
   ```
     
2. Download Linux binaries from Bitcoin Core repository, verify checksums and signatures
   ```js
   wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```
   ```js
   wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/SHA256SUMS.asc
   wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/SHA256SUMS
   wget https://bitcoin.org/laanwj-releases.asc
   ```

## Check binaries
   1. Checksum check: check that the reference checksum in file `SHA256SUMS` matches the calculated checksum
      ```js
      sha256sum --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
      ```
      Output: "bitcoin-0.16.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz: OK"

   2. Manually check the fingerprint of the public key
      ```js
      sudo gpg ./laanwj-releases.asc
      ```
      Output: 01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964
   3. Signature check: Import the public key and verify the checksums file is cryptographically signes by the signed key
      ```js
      sudo gpg --import ./laanwj-releases.asc
      sudo gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
      ```
      Output: "Good signature from Wladimir ..."

## Installation
1. Extract the Bitcoin Core binaries, install them and check everything is fine by running `bitcoind`. Finally remove the tar file to save disk space
   ```js
   sudo tar -xzvf bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```
   ```js
   sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-$VERSION/bin/bitcoin-cli bitcoin-$VERSION/bin/bitcoind
   ```
   ```js
   bitcoind --version
   ```
   Output: Bitcoin Core Daemon version ...
   ```js
   rm /home/ubuntu/bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```

## Setup directories
External hard drive is one of the most inexpensive ways to store the blockchain. If you have a spare and emply drive of sufficient size, here's how to set it up.
1. Plug in the external hard drive and mount it

2. Add a symbolic link (soft link) that points the freshly created `.bitcoind` directory on the root to the external hard disk 
   1. This folder is where all the blockchain data is stored. If you deleted it, then the next time you launched Bitcoin it would just begin to sync from the beginning, creating all of the data files stored in this directory once again. 
      ```js
      sudo ln -s /media/ubuntu/B680AD7C80AD43A9/.bitcoin /home/ubuntu/.bitcoin
      ```
   2. Navigate to the home directory and check the symbolic link is not shown in red (this would indicate an error). The content of this directory will actually be on the external hard disk
      ```js
      ls -la .bitcoin
      ```
      
## Setup configuration file
1. By default `bitcoind` searches for the configuration file `bitcoin.conf` in the default hidden direcotry `~/.bitcoin`. Download the configuration file (which manages all bitcoind settings) from repo and copy it into the default bitcoin-core's data directory. 
   ```js
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyboy101/Cookbook/refs/heads/master/bitcoin.conf
   sudo cp /home/ubuntu/bitcoin.conf /home/ubuntu/.bitcoin
   ```
 
## Running Bitcoin Core
1. Launch the deamon and start up the Initial Block Download (IBD)
    ```js
    bitcoind
    ```
    or override via argument the default configuration by specifying the position of the configuration file:
    ```js
    bitcoind -conf=/home/ubuntu/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
    ```

> [!NOTE]  
>* You can always stop at anytime the Initial Blockchain Download (IBD) by pressing on terminal `Ctl+c`
>   
>* Note that you can’t run both the GUI version `bitcoin-qt` and the daemon `bitcoind` at the same time using the same configuration directory.
>
>* You may optionally prefer to sync the blockcain (i.e. the Initial Blockchain Download IBD) over the regular _clearnet_ for speed, and then switching to Tor afterwards by adding Tor configuration into the `bitcoin.conf` file.

# Part 2 - Aftermath of IBD and Debugging
1. Reduce the cache size by commenting `dbcache` and `blocksonly`
   ```js
   nano .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
   ```
2. Make changes effective by relaunching bitcoin daemon
   ```js
   sudo systemctl restart bitcoind
   ```
3. Check everything works
   ```js
   journalctl -fu bitcoind
   ```
4. Watch progress or debug if something gows wrong by running
   ```js
   tail -n 100 -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log
   ```
<br /><br />

# Part 3 - Security

Make sure that your node is visible from the Internet and secured against unauthorized remote access.

<a name="part3.1"></a>
## #1 Login with SSH keys

One of the best options to secure the sensitive SSH login is to disable passwords altogether and require an SSH certificate. Only someone with physical possession of the private certificate key can log in.

### Generate SSH keys in Windows
Follow this guide [Configure “No Password SSH Keys Authentication” with PuTTY on Linux Servers](https://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-with-putty/)

1. You have now generated three new files. Keep them save!
   * `RaspiBolt-Private-Key.ppk`
   * `RaspiBolt-Public-Key`
   * `authorized-Keys.txt`

2. You also copied the content of `authorized-Keys.txt` into the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your Pi and changed the directory's permissions to `700`.

3. After specifying your private key file in the PuTTY configuration, you're all set.

### Generate SSH keys on Linux
1. In the terminal on your regular computer, check if keys already exist
   ```js
   ls -la ~/.ssh/*.pub
   ```
   
3. If files are listed, your public key should be named something like `id_rsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa.pub`.
   If one of these files already exists, skip the next step.

4. If none of those files exist, or you get a "No such file or directory" error, create a new public / private key pair:
   ```js
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```
   When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to use the default file location.
   Optionally, for maximum security, use `password [A]` to protect your key.

5. The public key now needs to be copied to the server.
   Use the command `ssh-copy-id`, which stores your public key on the remote machine (and creates files and directories, if needed).
   You will be prompted for your SSH login password once.
   ```js
   ssh-copy-id admin@raspibolt.local
   ```

### Disable password login
1. Log in as "admin" using SSH with your SSH key. You shouldn't be prompted for the admin's password anymore.
2. Edit the ssh configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to harden our security.
   ```js
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
3. Uncomment the following option to disable password authentification
   ```js
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```
4. Below the commented out `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` option, add the following line to disable s/key, a one-time password authentification. Save and exit.
   ```js
   #ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
   KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
   ```
5. Restart the SSH daemon, then exit your session
   ```js
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   exit
   ```
6. Log in again with user "admin"

From now on you can no longer log in with a password. User "admin" is the only user that has the necessary SSH keys, no other user can log in remotely.


<a name="part3.2"></a>
## #2 Enabling the Uncomplicated Firewall

The node will be visible from the internet and therefore needs to be secured against attacks. A firewall controls what kind of outside traffic is permitted and closes potential security holes.
By default, many network ports are open and listening for incoming connections.

For now, only SSH should be reachable from the outside.
Bitcoin Core is using Tor and don't need incoming ports.
We'll open the port for Electrs and web applications later if needed.

1. With user "admin", configure and enable the firewall rules
   ```js
   sudo apt install ufw
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   sudo ufw default allow outgoing
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   sudo ufw logging off
   sudo ufw enable
   ```
> [!NOTE]  
> If you are seeing: `ERROR: Couldn't determine iptables version` you may need to reboot after installing `ufw`
   
2. Make sure that the UFW is started automatically on boot
   ```js
   sudo systemctl enable ufw
   ```

3. Check if `ssh` access is allowed (but limited), with:
   ```js
   sudo ufw limit ssh
   ```

4. Add a few more limitations on `ssh`. If you are planning on accessing your node from local network LAN only:
   ```js
   sudo ufw allow from 16.32.64.128 to any port 22
   ```

5. To allow for Bitcoin traffic, do:
   ```js
   # for mainnet ...
   sudo ufw allow 8333 comment "Bitcoin mainnet"
   # ... or for testnet
   sudo ufw allow 18333 comment "Bitcoin testnet"
   # ... or lightning
   sudo ufw allow 9735 comment 'allow Lightning'
   ```

6. Check if the UFW is properly configured and active
   ```js
   sudo ufw status verbose
   ```
   ```js
   > Status: active
   > Logging: on (low)
   > Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
   > New profiles: skip
   >
   > To                         Action      From
   > --                         ------      ----
   > SSH                        ALLOW       Anywhere
   > SSH (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
   ```
   
   
> [!TIP]
> `ufw` default rules allow for all outgoing connections, but block all incoming connections

## #3 Install fail2ban

The SSH login to the node must be expecially protected. The firewall blocks all login attempts from outside, but additional steps should be
taken to prevent an attacker (maybe from inside your network) from gaining access via brute force by try out all possible password.
The first measure is to install "fail2ban", a system that simply cuts off any remote system with five failed login attempts for ten minutes.
This makes a brute-force attack unfeasible, as it would simply take too long.

1. Install "fail2ban", which activates automatically
   ```js
   sudo apt install fail2ban -y
   ```

   The initial configuration is fine, as it protects SSH by default.

> [!TIP]
> *more: [customize fail2ban configuration](https://linode.com/docs/security/using-fail2ban-for-security/)*

<a name="part3.4"></a>
## #4 Increase your open files limit

If your server is swamped with internet requests (honest or malicious due to a DoS attack), you will quickly encounter the "can't accept connection: too many open files" error.
This is due to the limit of open files (representing individual TCP connections) set too low.

1. Create the file `/etc/security/limits.d/90-limits.conf`, copy these lines into it, save and exit

   ```js
   sudo nano /etc/security/limits.d/90-limits.conf

   *    soft nofile 128000
   *    hard nofile 128000
   root soft nofile 128000
   root hard nofile 128000
   ```

2. Edit both of the following two files, add the additional line(s) right before the end comment, save and exit.

   ```js
   sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session
   session required                        pam_limits.so
   ```

   ```js
   sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive
   session required                        pam_limits.so
   ```

## #5 Prepare NGINX reverse proxy

Several components of this guide will expose a communication port, for example the Electrum server or the Block Explorer.
Even if you use these services only within your own home network, communication should always be encrypted.
Otherwise, any device in the same network can listen to the exchanged data, including passwords.

We use NGINX to encrypt the communication with SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security).
This setup is called a "reverse proxy": NGINX provides secure communication to the outside and routes the traffic back to the internal service without encryption.

> [!TIP]
> _NGINX is pronounced "Engine X"_ ;)

1. Install NGINX

   ```js
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```
2. Create a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate (valid for 10 years)

   ```js
   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt -subj "/CN=localhost" -days 3650
   ```

3. NGINX is also a full webserver.
   To use it only as a reverse proxy, remove the default configuration and paste the following configuration into the `nginx.conf` file.

   ```js
   sudo mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```

   ```nginx
   user www-data;
   worker_processes 1;
   pid /run/nginx.pid;
   include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

   events {
     worker_connections 768;
   }

   stream {
     ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
     ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
     ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
     ssl_session_timeout 4h;
     ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
     ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

     include /etc/nginx/streams-enabled/*.conf;

   }
   ```

4. Create a new directory for future configuration files

   ```js
   sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/streams-enabled
   ```

5. Test this barebone NGINX configuration

   ```js
   sudo nginx -t
   ```
   ```js
   > nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
   > nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```
  
   If you run into the `unknown directive "stream"` error, then you need to install the stream module first:

   ```js
   sudo apt install libnginx-mod-stream
   ```

<br /><br />

## #6 Disable wireless interfaces

The hardware supporting the node may come with Wifi and Bluetooth built-in.
That's great for most projects, but we should turn off all radios that are not needed for a security-focused device.

1. Open the configuration file, go to the following comment and add the applicable options below

   ```js
   $ sudo nano /boot/config.txt
   ```

   Additional overlays and parameters are documented `/boot/overlays/README`
   

2. Disable Bluetooth by adding this line

    ```
    dtoverlay=disable-bt
    ```

3. If you're running your RaspiBolt with a network cable, disable wifi by adding this line

    ```
    dtoverlay=disable-wifi
    ```

4. Save and exit.

   The disabled radios will no longer be active on the next reboot.

# Part 4 - Privacy: Install, configure and launch Tor  

Running your own Bitcoin node at home makes you a direct, sovereign peer on the Bitcoin network. However, if not configured without privacy in mind, it also tells the world that there is someone with Bitcoin at that address.

True, it's only your IP address that is revealed, but using services like [iplocation.net](https://www.iplocation.net), your physical address can be determined quite accurately.
We need to make sure that you keep your privacy.

We'll also make it easy to connect to your node from outside your home network as an added benefit.

In this section we will first cover how to install Tor, and then make sure that Bitcoin is properly configured to run only over Tor, so our IP address isn't revealed to the world. This will not change any network behavior when you’re browsing/using the Internet, and everything you normally do will still go over the normal Internet. Starting Tor just means that the Tor software is ready to be used by other software. Starting Tor when the computer starts just means we don’t have to remember to launch it every time we start our Bitcoin nodes.

---

## Install Tor

1. Install the dependency
   ```js
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https
   ```
2. Create a new file via nano called `tor.list` 
   ```js
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
   ```
   and add the following entries for the precomplied packages `deb` and the source code `deb-src` hosted in the repository
   ```js   
   deb     [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org jammy main
   deb-src [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org jammy main
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
   ```
   Save and exit by pressing `CTRL+X`, then confirm with `Y`
2. Then up to `"root"` user temporarily to add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following commands, and finally logout from `"root"` and return to `admin` using `exit`
   ```js
   sudo su
   ```
   ```js   
   wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
   ```
   ```js
   exit
   ```
3. Install Tor and Tor debian keyring
   ```js
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get install -y tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```
4. Check Tor has been correctly installed
   ```js
   tor --version
   ```
   
## Configuring Tor for Bitcoin

Bitcoin Core communicate directly with the Tor daemon to route all traffic through the Tor network. We need to enable Tor to accept commands via its control port, with the proper authentication.

1. Modify Tor configuration on torrc
   ```js
   sudo nano +56 /etc/tor/torrc --linenumbers
   ```   
2. Open port 9051 eliminating symbol `#` from raw Nr. 56
3. Relaunch Tor service to make changes effective 
    ```js
    sudo systemctl reload tor
    ```
4. Check Tor is up and listening default ports 9050 and 9051 in localhost (127.0.0.1)
    ```js
    sudo ss -tulpn | grep tor
    ```
    Expected output:
   ```js
   tcp   LISTEN 0      4096           127.0.0.1:9050       0.0.0.0:*    users:(("tor",pid=1847,fd=6))
   tcp   LISTEN 0      4096           127.0.0.1:9051       0.0.0.0:*    users:(("tor",pid=1847,fd=7))
   ```

5. Check the systemd journal to see tor real time updates output logs
   ```js
   sudo journalctl -f -u tor@default
   ``` 

6. Start `bitcoind` and grep tor-specific logs
    ```js
    bitcoind & tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log | grep tor
    ```  

> [!WARNING]  
> If something gets wrong, [Jameson Lopp](https://blog.lopp.net/how-to-run-bitcoin-as-a-tor-hidden-service-on-ubuntu/) has a Tor tutorial that covers a variety of potential errors. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Your computer is now running Tor. All that means Tor software is ready to be used by other software. Not all internet traffic is routed over the Tor network, just specific applications that try to connect over Tor (such as Bitcoin Core).   
> 
> * **You don't want to run Tor at all:** just remove all Tor configurations
> * **You want to run Bitcoin over the regular Internet ***and*** Tor:** Remove all the Tor configurations except for `proxy=127.0.0.1:9050`. This will remove all of the restrictions the other settings make, but still tell Bitcoin Core that you're also running Tor and how to connect over it _as well as_ the regular clearnet way.
> * **You want to sync the blockchain over the regular Internet, and then run your node over Tor:** Remove all the Tor configuratios except for `proxy=127.0.0.1:9050`, and then when your node is synced, add the Tor configuration back in. Leaving the proxy setting in allows your node to grow a list of onion peers for when you do run over Tor later. If you do this, you can exclude the all of the `addnode=` seeds from the `bitcoin.conf` file, or just remove them later.



## SSH remote access through Tor 

If you want to lof into your server with SSH when you are away, you can easily do so by adding a Tor hidden service. This makes "calling home" very easy, without the need to configure anything on your internet router.

### SSH server

1. Add the following theree lines in the "location-hidden-services" section of the `torrc` file. Save and exit
   ```js
   sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
   ```   
   ```js
   ############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###
   # Hidden Service SSH server
   HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_sshd/
   HiddenServiceVersion 3
   HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
   ```  

2. Reload Tor configuration and look up your Tor connection address
   ```js
   sudo systemctl reload tor
   sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_sshd/hostname
   > abcdefg..............xyz.onion
   ```   

6. Save the Tor address in a secure location, e.g., your password manager


### SSH client
You also need to have Tor installed on your regular computer where you start the SSH connection. Usage of SSH over Tor differs by client and operating system.

* **Windows**: configure PuTTY as describbed in this guide [Torifying PuTTY](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Putty) by the Tor Project.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using PuTTY and fail to connect to your Pi by setting port 9050 in the PuTTY proxy settings, try setting port 9150 instead. When Tor runs as an installed application instead of a background process it uses port 9150.

# Part 5 - Connecting to internet
To make the node reachable from the internet, we assign it a static address

1. Look for the address

   ```js
   ipconfig
   ```   

2. Setting a fixed address
   Set the static IP under DHCP server. The manual address should be the same as the current address, just change the last part to a lower number (e.g. 192.168.0.240 → 192.168.0.20).

3. Port forwarding
   Different applications use different network ports, and the router needs to know to which internal network device the traffic of a specific port has to be directed. The port forwarding need to be set up as follows:

Service       | Port range / External Port | Internal / Local Port | Internal / Local IP address  | Protocol (TCP or UDP)
--------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------
`bitcoind`    | 8333                       | 8333                  | 192.168.0.20                 | BOTH
`bitcoind test`    | 18333                 | 18333                 | 192.168.0.20                 | BOTH
`lightning`   | 9735                       | 9735                  | 192.168.0.20                 | BOTH

   Save and apply these router settings. Restart the node. It should now get the new fixed IP address.


<a name="part6"></a>
# Part 6 - RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) API interaction
If everything seems to run smoothly, this is the perfect time to familiarize with Bitcoin Core and play around with `bitcoin-cli` until the IBD is terminated.
Check out the `bitcoin-cli` reference for additional information: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list
