# ---[ IBD (Initial Block Download) ]-------------------------------------
# These settings must be commented after IBD completion!

# Set the dimension of dbcache in megabyte from 4 to 16384, default: 300 
# based on RAM available on device
# suggestion: dbcache=1/2 x RAM available, e.g.: 4GB RAM -> dbcache=2048
dbcache=8000

# Whether to reject transactions from network peers. Automatic broadcast
# and rebroadcast of any transactions from inbound peers is
# disabled, unless the peer has the 'forcerelay' permission. RPC
# transactions are not affected. (default: 0)
blocksonly=1


# ---[ Other usual settings ]--------------------------------------------

# Bitcoin daemon
server=1

# Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands (default: 0). If you run it as a daemon, 
# you can check the progress in the debug.log in the .bitcoind dir.
#daemon=1

# Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc call (default: 0). 
# Only set this for development purposes - it's not needed if you just want to run a full node.
#txindex=1

# Specify the ".bitcoin" data directory to hold blocks subdirectory for *.dat files (default:
# <datadir>)
#blocksdir=/media/ubuntu/B680AD7C80AD43A9/blocks

# Specify data directory
#datadir=/media/ubuntu/B680AD7C80AD43A9/blocks

# Imports blocks from external file on startup
#loadblock=<file>

# Force your node to validate every transaction & block from the Genesis block
assumevalid=0

# Reduce storage requirements by enabling pruning (deleting) of old
# blocks. This allows the pruneblockchain RPC to be called to
# delete specific blocks, and enables automatic pruning of old
# blocks if a target size in MiB is provided. This mode is
# incompatible with -txindex and -coinstatsindex. Warning:
# Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire
# blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow
# manual pruning via RPC, >=550 = automatically prune block files
# to stay under the specified target size in MiB)
#prune=10000

# Disable integrated wallet
disablewallet=1

# Additional logs (default: -nodebug)
#debug=net

# Specfy location of debug log file (default: debug.log). 
# Pass -nodebuglogfile to disable writing the log to a file
#debuglogfile=<file>

# Disable debug.log
#nodebuglogfile=1

# Activate all block filter (default: 0) Only set this for development purposes 
# it's not needed if you just want to run a full node.
#blockfilterindex=1

# Serve filters with compact blocks to peer as per BIP 157
#peerblockfilters=1

# Maintain index coinstats used by RPC gettxoutsetinfo (default: 0). 
# Only set this for development purposes - it's not needed if you just want to run a full node
#coinstatsindex=1

# Adds custom comment
#uacomment=user node


# ---[ Network settings ]-----------------------------------------------

# Accept connections from outside (default: 1 if no -proxy or -connect)
listen=1

## P2P bind
#bind=127.0.0.1

## Proxify clearnet outbound connections using Tor SOCKS5 proxy
#proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

# Maintain at most <n> connections to peers (default: 125). This limit
# does not apply to connections manually added via -addnode or the
# addnode RPC, which have a separate limit of 8.
#maxconnections=<n>
